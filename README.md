# SavorNet-Adaptive-Attention-Fusion-for-Ethiopian-Cuisine-Classification
SavorNet: Adaptive Attention Fusion for Ethiopian Cuisine Classification Overview SavorNet is a deep learning model designed to classify traditional Ethiopian dishes, addressing the underrepresentation of Ethiopian cuisine in existing food recognition systems.
# Key Features
Uses adaptive attention fusion to dynamically combine features from DenseNet121 and ResNet50V2 backbones.
Outperforms traditional ensemble methods and individual models.
Achieved 92.2% test accuracy and 96.1% top-2 accuracy on a curated Ethiopian food dataset.
